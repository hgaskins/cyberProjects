Project Title: KeyLogger

Project Description: KeyLogger is a basic key logger application written in python. I am using this to brush up on python in addition to get started on cyber security projects. Musings thus far: there are SOOOO MANY key logger applications/tutorials online and it isn't very hard for someone with minimal knowledge to develop a key logger. Both cool and concerning.
